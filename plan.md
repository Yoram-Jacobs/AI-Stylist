# DressApp — Development Plan (Core-first) **UPDATED (post Phase U kickoff)**

## 1) Objectives
- ✅ **Phase 1 shipped**: Architecture + MongoDB schema + provider POC script.
- ✅ **Phase 2 shipped**: Fully functional backend (auth, users, closet, listings, transactions w/ fee math, stylist pipeline).
- ✅ **Vision stack migrated & stabilised** (fal.ai removed entirely):
  - **Segmentation (cutout)**: Hugging Face Inference using **`mattmdjaga/segformer_b2_clothes`**.
  - **Image generate/edit**: Hugging Face **FLUX.1-schnell**.
- ✅ **Phase 3 shipped**: React frontend compiles, screenshot‑verified, integration-tested.
- ✅ **Phase 4 shipped (partial)**: Google Calendar OAuth + Trend‑Scout autonomous agent.
- ✅ **Phase 5 shipped**: Admin dashboard, provider activity monitoring, accessibility + SEO hardening.
- ✅ **Add Item overhaul shipped**: batch upload + animated scanning + "The Eyes" auto-fill + rich closet schema + one‑click auto‑listing.
- ✅ **Multi-Item Outfit Extraction shipped**: one uploaded photo → N editable item cards with IoU-NMS dedupe + "already cropped" short-circuit.
- ✅ **Closet Bulk Delete shipped**: multi-select mode on `/closet` with confirmation dialog + parallel deletes.
- ✅ **Phase A shipped**: provider-dispatched Eyes (Gemini default, Gemma HF path ready), **local FashionCLIP embeddings**, semantic search, Marketplace similar-items, native camera capture.
- ⏳ **Phase 6 Model Merge & Hosting (P0)**: off-pod merge of fine-tuned Gemma 4 E2B LoRA adapter → merged model → GGUF export + hosting (**blocked on external execution**).
- ✅ **Phase L Internationalization (i18n) initiative (P0)**: curated 12-language UI with full RTL mirroring for Hebrew/Arabic + per-user language persistence + AI output localization.
- ✅ **Phase L+ Taxonomy & Menus Translation Sweep (P0)**: no English leakage in dropdowns/menus in Hebrew mode (verified by screenshots).
- ✅ **Post-L+ follow-up**: Stylist language reliability improved (prompt preamble); and **sub_category/item_type display localization** (taxonomy mappings + hints + The Eyes directive updated).
- ✅ **Phase M System-native Speech (STT/TTS)**: Web Speech API (native) with Groq/Deepgram fallback.
- ✅ **Phase P Outfit Completion**: weighted centroids + weather awareness + UI reorder.
- ✅ **Phase Q Wardrobe Reconstructor**: HF FLUX outpainting + category-drift validation + manual Repair workflow.
- ✅ **Item Detail Edit Page**: full manual editor for closet items.
- ✅ **Phase R shipped**: **Multi-session Stylist + Fashion Scout side panel + chat image evidence**.
- ✅ **Phase S shipped**: **Device Access (Location UX) + Marketplace proximity + Region-aware Fashion Scout + share/invite + Professional CTA scaffold**.
- ✅ **Phase T shipped**: **Extended Profile & Settings** (full schema + UI + OAuth autofill).
- 🟡 **Phase U (NEW / NEXT)**: **Experts Pool + Ads/Campaigns + Ad Ticker + Ask-a-Professional directory**.
- 🎯 **Payments next**: PayPlus payments integration — deferred until API credentials are available.

> **Operational note:** EMERGENT_LLM_KEY budget is topped up with auto‑recharge. Text/multimodal calls (Stylist + The Eyes + Fashion‑Scout) are expected to be stable, but transient upstream 503s may still occur (handled gracefully).

### Phase S — Device Access + Contacts UX + Region-aware Scout + Professionals scaffold **(P0 / COMPLETE)**

#### Phase S.0 — Product constraints (web vs native) **(ACKNOWLEDGED)**
DressApp is currently a web app:
- ✅ **Location**: supported via `navigator.geolocation` on HTTPS.
- ⚠️ **Contacts**: full device address-book access is not available cross-browser on the web.
  - Best-effort (Android Chrome): Contact Picker API (`navigator.contacts.select`).
  - Universal: Web Share API (`navigator.share`) + clipboard fallback.

#### Phase S.A — Location permission + propagation **(COMPLETE)**
- ✅ `LocationProvider` + `useLocation()` hook (`/app/frontend/src/lib/location.jsx`)
  - Permission state + local caching + reverse geocode (Nominatim)
  - Persists to `users.home_location`
- ✅ In-app first-run banner (`LocationBanner`) on Home/Stylist/Market
- ✅ Profile Location settings card (refresh + forget)

#### Phase S.B — Marketplace proximity **(COMPLETE)**
- ✅ Backend: `/listings` supports `lat,lng,radius_km` via `$geoNear` and returns `distance_km`.
- ✅ Frontend: radius selector + distance chips.

#### Phase S.C — Region-aware Fashion Scout localization **(COMPLETE)**
- ✅ `trend_reports` supports per-language cards with cached translation on-demand (Gemini Flash).
- ✅ API: `GET /trends/fashion-scout?language=…&country=…`
- ✅ Frontend: Fashion Scout panel passes user language + device/home country code.

#### Phase S.D — Contacts UX (web-first) + Share/Invite **(COMPLETE)**
- ✅ `ShareOutfitButton` on outfit recommendations (Web Share API + clipboard fallback).
- ✅ `InviteFriendsButton` on Profile (Web Share API + clipboard fallback).
- ✅ Minimal share backend:
  - `POST /share/outfit` and `GET /share/outfit/{id}`

#### Phase S.E — Professionals scaffold **(COMPLETE)**
- ✅ Disabled "Ask a professional" CTA on Stylist composer + location-aware copy.

---

### Phase T — Extended Profile & Settings **(P0 / COMPLETE)**

**Goal**: Build a complete Profile & Settings experience matching the required signup/profile layout, with selective autofill from OAuth.

#### Phase T.A — Backend schema + update API **(COMPLETE)**
- ✅ User doc extended:
  - `first_name`, `last_name`, `phone`, `date_of_birth`, `sex`, `personal_status`
  - `address` (nested)
  - `units` (weight/length)
  - `face_photo_url`, `body_photo_url`
  - `body_measurements` (nested)
  - `hair` (nested)
- ✅ `UpdateUserIn` accepts all of the above.

#### Phase T.B — OAuth-derived autofill (Google) **(COMPLETE)**
- ✅ `calendar_service.persist_tokens_for_user` auto-fills on first connect:
  - `display_name`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `avatar_url`, `locale`
  - **Never clobbers** existing user-entered values.

#### Phase T.C — Frontend Profile UI **(COMPLETE)**
- ✅ `ProfileDetailsCard.jsx` (accordion): Identity / Contact / Demographics / Units / Photos / Measurements / Hair.
- ✅ Conditional female-only rows (Bra size, Dress size).

---

### Phase U — Experts Pool + Ad Campaigns + Ticker **(P0 / NOT STARTED)**

**Goal**: Let users self-enlist as professional fashion experts, appear in a regional directory, and run paid campaigns. “Ask a Professional” routes to the directory. Regional ads render as a running ticker on Home footer and Experts page.

#### Phase U.A — Experts Pool schema + profile UI (P0)
**Backend**
- Add `User.professional` nested doc:
  - `is_professional: bool`
  - `profession: str` (e.g., Stylist, Barber, Fashion designer)
  - `business: { name, address, phone, email, website, description }`
  - `approval_status: 'self' | 'hidden'` (MVP; default 'self')
  - `created_at`, `updated_at`
- Extend `PATCH /users/me` to accept `professional`.
- Admin endpoint to flag/hide:
  - `POST /admin/professionals/{user_id}/hide`
  - `POST /admin/professionals/{user_id}/unhide`

**Frontend**
- Add “Professional” accordion section to Profile:
  - Checkbox “Professional fashion expert?” reveals Profession + Business Details fields.
  - Inline note: “Visible in Experts directory” when enabled.
- i18n keys for the entire section (EN/HE/AR curated).

#### Phase U.B — Professionals directory endpoints (P0)
**Backend**
- `GET /professionals` with filters:
  - `country`, `region`, `profession`
  - exclude `approval_status='hidden'`
  - optionally require `is_professional=true`
- `GET /professionals/{id}`

**Frontend**
- New `/experts` directory page:
  - Filter bar (region, profession)
  - Grid cards (name, profession, business name, city, website/contact CTA)
  - Details modal or details route.

#### Phase U.C — Ads / campaigns (Facebook-inspired, one-level) (P0)
**Backend**
- New collection `ad_campaigns`:
  - `{ id, owner_id, name, profession, creative {headline, body, image_url, cta_url}, daily_budget_cents, bid_cents, start_date, end_date, target_country, target_region, status, impressions, clicks, spent_cents }`
- CRUD endpoints (owner-only):
  - `POST /ads/campaigns`
  - `GET /ads/campaigns`
  - `GET /ads/campaigns/{id}`
  - `PATCH /ads/campaigns/{id}`
  - `DELETE /ads/campaigns/{id}`
- Auction-lite serving:
  - `GET /ads/ticker?country=…&region=…&limit=5`
  - Eligibility: active + within dates + region match + budget remaining
  - Selection: weighted by `bid_cents` with budget pacing (e.g. weight = bid * remaining_daily_budget)
- Tracking:
  - `POST /ads/impression/{id}`
  - `POST /ads/click/{id}`

**Admin**
- Admin hide/disable campaign endpoint:
  - `POST /admin/ads/campaigns/{id}/disable`

> **Billing note:** PayPlus is not yet integrated; Phase U will track impressions/clicks/spend counters but will not charge real money until PayPlus ships.

#### Phase U.D — Frontend Ads Manager (P0)
- New `/ads` page (for professionals only):
  - List campaigns, create/edit form, pause/resume, delete.
  - Creative preview tile.
  - Basic analytics: impressions, clicks, spent.

#### Phase U.E — AdTicker component + placements (P0)
- `AdTicker` running strip:
  - Visible on Home footer + Experts page.
  - Region-aware (uses device/home location country/region).
  - Auto-rotating cards: creative headline + small image + CTA.

#### Phase U.F — Wire Stylist “Ask a Professional” CTA (P0)
- Enable the CTA (currently disabled scaffold) to route to `/experts`.
- When location available, pre-filter directory to user’s country/region.

#### Phase U.G — QA  i18n (P0)
- EN/HE/AR translations for all new Professional/Ads UI.
- RTL layout checks.
- Screenshot audit: Profile, Experts directory, Ads manager, Home ticker, Stylist CTA.
